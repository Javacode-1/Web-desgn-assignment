            <p>Hello! I'm Michael Ampomah, a BSc. Computer Engineering student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Raised by an amazing family made up of my Parents and 3 siblings, I'm grateful for the values and support that have shaped me.</p>
            <p>I was fortunate to attend the prestigious Osei Kyeretwie Senior High School in Kumasi, Ghana.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm excited to the explore the world of computer engineering, fueled my love for electronics, creativity and curiosity.</p>

        <h1 class="header-h1">WHY COMPUTER ENGINEERING?</h1>
        <p>
            I am remimded of the time I decided to pursue Computer Engineering. In fact it was a tough decision to make but all the same it was an importantr one too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I was fascinated by the rapid revolution of technology and its profound impact on our daily lives. From smartphones to laptops doing all the seemingly magical stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            My curioity led me to explore the field of Computer Science but I later discovered that computer engineering was meant for me; the blend of hands-on electronic projects with the headache of debugging codes was the best I could ever dream of.
